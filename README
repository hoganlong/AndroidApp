AndroidApp
----------

A framework for developing an Android App using the following technologies: 
  * Maven for building, testing and deployment.
  * Robolectric as a unit testing framework.

The purpose of the framework is to provide a workflow for developing 
Android applications using TDD. The main ideas behind the project are:
  * Do not depend on an Android emulator.
  * Develop rapidly using unit testing.
  * Try the application in real devices.

Maven
-----

Maven is a project management tool that provides mechanisms to automate builds,
generation of documentation, track dependencies and much, much more.

More information can be found in the proyect's website:

Robolectric
-----------

Robolectric is a testing framework for Android that allows you to run your
test without using an Android emulator. More information about the project
can be found on:

I also recommend to take a look at this sample project to start becoming
familiar with the framework:
