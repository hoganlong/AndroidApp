AndroidApp
----------

Boilerplate for developing an Android App using the following technologies: 

  * Maven for building, testing and deployment.
  * Robolectric as a unit testing framework.

The purpose is to provide a workflow for developing Android applications using 
TDD. The main ideas behind the project are:

  * Do not depend on an Android emulator.
  * Develop rapidly using unit testing.
  * Try the application in real devices.

Maven
-----

Maven is a project management tool that provides mechanisms to automate builds,
generation of documentation, track dependencies and much, much more. Maven's 
settings file is `pom.xml`.

More information can be found in the proyect's website:

    http://maven.apache.org/

Robolectric
-----------

Robolectric is a testing framework for Android that allows you to run your
test without using an Android emulator. More information about the project
can be found on:

    http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/

I also recommend to take a look at this sample project to start becoming
familiar with the framework:

Goodies
-------

I'm also using Kenneth Reitz's autoenv:

      https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv

`.env` file contains a number of handy aliases to use when we are working on
a project:

  * `install` runs the `mvn install` command.
  * `test` runs the project's test suite.
  * `deploy` packages and puts the apk in the target emulator 
     or connected devices.

TODO
----

* write a script for automating the renaming of packages, app name, developer, etc.
